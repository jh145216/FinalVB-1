# ART of WAR

ART of WAR is a 2d platformer game. In the game you will collect flags to move to the next level and to get to the next level there will be a ship that will take you to the next level. There are 3 levels that you have to bet until you won the game. If you fail on a level you will have to restart the game.

We used Visual Studio 2013 to make our game.

Jimmy Phillip Pham Ho and Joey Huff made ART of WAR.
